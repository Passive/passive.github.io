## Introduction
In this blog post I talk about this blog and what you may learn from it, I will go
more in-depth in a later post. But for now this will do.

## What you can learn
On this blog I will post about Reverse Engineering and C / C++ game hacking topics. For
the past 2 - 3 years I have been learning about game hacking and reverse engineering in
my spare time, not to mention just general programming.

If you look at my github you will see mostly trash-filled repos that have terrible code,
but this blog will **not** contain any of that.

Here you will find neat, nicely formatted code that will guide you and help you to learn
more quickly and easily.

## About myself
I have been learning about programming and programming concepts for 5 years now, and hopefully
more to come. I don't plan to get a job that relates to the topic of programming as I am happy
with my current job.
